Lab 1.1 - mycat
===============

## Run the file 
In order to run the lab you have two options, first is compile and run manually, this will allow you to test any file you want in mycat.c

```
	gcc mycat.c -o mycat.o
	./mycat.o test.txt

```

The other option is to use the **makefile**, the only disadvantage is that the file it will read will always be test.txt unless the makefile is modified. To run the makefile:

```
	make

```

# Performance
If you want to see what is the performance of 'mycat.c' then you can read the PDF in this same folder named: **mycat_performance.pdf**
