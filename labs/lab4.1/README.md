Lab 4.1 - Mutexes and Conditional Variables
===========================================

General Requirements and Considerations
---------------------------------------
- Use the logger that was done on [lab2.4](https://github.com/CodersSquad/ap-labs/tree/master/labs/lab2.4).
- Replace all printing functions by the proper logger functions.
- Use the `*.c` files for implementing your code.
- Use the `Makefile` for compilation.
- Update `README.md` with the proper steps for building and running your code.
- Don't forget to handle errors properly.
- Coding best practices implementation will be also considered.


Compile
==================
First use the makefile

````
make
````

To clean binaries run
````
make clear
````

To run just decide which file and do this
`````
./<filename>
`````

### Filenames
- bug1
- bug1fix

- arrayloops
- condvar

And that's it
