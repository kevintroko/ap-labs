# Challenge 01

## Prerequisites
To have java installed in your machine (the latest version the better, Java SE10 is fine) 

## Run the code 
go to the folder where you have the java file (ap-labs/challenges/chal1)

### Compile
javac codechallenge01.java

### Test 
java codechallenge

*sorry for this readme but my time run out. 

## Remastered version
I created a new version of the program in the folder 

(ap-labs/challenges/chal1/codechallenge-remastered)

codechallenge-remastered. The main reason is because this didn't passed all the test. But I work on it again to succeed.


I also added a makefile in the Remastered version.
